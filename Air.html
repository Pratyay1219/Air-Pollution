                <h2>Introduction of Air Pollution</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere.

                Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. 
                
                 By understanding the root causes of air pollution and its detrimental effects, we develop tailored approaches that empower individuals, communities, and organizations to take action. Our services range from educational campaigns and awareness programs to implementing sustainable practices and technologies. Join us in our mission to breathe cleaner air and build a sustainable future. </p>

              <p>Indoor air quality monitoring is the process of gathering continuous data on the particles, gasses, and chemicals present in your air. The goal of collecting this data is to identify trends, spot problem areas, and make adjustments accordingly. Building owners, facility managers, and technicians may introduce monitoring to reduce airborne disease risk, identify areas that inhibit occupant wellbeing, and detect anomalies like mold growth.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Outdoor air quality monitoring is the process of measuring the quantity and types of pollutants in the atmosphere. This information can be used to improve air quality. 
 
                    Air quality is measured with the Air Quality Index (AQI). The AQI works like a thermometer that runs from 0 to 500 degrees. Instead of showing changes in temperature, the AQI shows changes in the amount of pollution in the air. </p>
